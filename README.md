# üí∏ MoneyMinder
MoneyMinder is 100% open-source python application designed to help users manage their accounts by keeping track of balances, setting goals, tracking credits and debits, and providing a convenient way to view their current balance. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
This application is currently under development and serves as a valuable learning experience for python programming.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have met the following prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_download/)
- [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or any IDE.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
- [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/), [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/) or any database management GUI if needed.

### Using Docker

If you prefer not to set up a MySQL database manually, I have provided a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project. This file will set up a MySQL database and Adminer, a web-based database management tool, for you.

Make sure you have met the following prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 


1. Run the following command to start the services
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

3. Update **MYSQL_** rows that are used with `docker-compose.yml`
    ```bash
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
    MYSQL_DATABASE=your_mysql_databse
    MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_username
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_user_password
    ```

4. Access the Adminer interface in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

**WARNING:** Docker services use the port `3306` for MySQL and `8080` for Adminer. Ensure these ports are available on your machine before running the command.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash

2. Install required dependancies with *pip*
    ```bash

    ```

3. Update the `.env` file based on `.env.example`
    ```bash
    DB_HOST=your_host
    DB_USER=your_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    DB_DATABASE=your_database
    ```

4. Run the main file to start the application
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
